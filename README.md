# Getting Started

## Installation

1. Create or update your `.zshrc` to source the config:
```sh
echo "source \$HOME/.config/zsh/main.zsh" > $HOME/.zshrc
```

**Note:** This will overwrite your existing `.zshrc`. If you already have one that you are fond of, make sure to **back it up first**:
```sh
cp .zshrc .zshrc.bak
```

2. Reload your shell or open a new one. To reload 
```sh
source ~/.zshrc
```
